ðŸ“Œ This data aim to fill the missing transaction from smaller and more localized shops because they do not have a 100% compliance rate in terms of scanning and inputting information into the POS machine for all transactions.
A transaction involving a single packet of chips or a single piece of candy may not be scanned and recorded to spare customer the inconvenience or during rush hours when the store is crowded with customers.
